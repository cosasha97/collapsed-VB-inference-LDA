# A Collapsed Variational Bayesian Inference Algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation
Project for the course of Bayesian Machine learning - Master MVA

We code the three methods proposed in 'A Collapsed Variational Bayesian Inference
Algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation'. In the file vb.py there is the variational Bayes method. In the file Gibbs.py there is the collapsed Gibbs method. In the file collapsed_VB.py it's the collapsed variational Bayes method. 

In the folder Data, we can find the KOS dataset and Reuters dataset. 

In the folder results, there is some saved results because of the high computation time of the collapsed variational method.

Finally, the notebook shows how to use the code and provides the results that can be found in the report.
