# A Collapsed Variational Bayesian Inference Algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation
Project for the course of Bayesian Machine learning - Master MVA

We coded the three methods proposed in 'A Collapsed Variational Bayesian Inference Algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation'. The scripts of these methods can be found in the following files:
- vb.py:  variational Bayes method
- Gibbs.py collapsed Gibbs method
- collapsed_VB.py: collapsed variational Bayes method

In the folder 'Data' are stored the KOS and Reuters datasets. 

In the folder 'results', there is some saved results because of the high computation time of the collapsed variational method.

## Generate the results
The notebook **LDA_notebook.ipynb** shows the reader how to use the scripts of the different methods and generate the results presented in the report.

## Requirements
See requirements.text
